    "# Anaconda Installation & Accessing Tutorial Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a guide to help you properly install and set up [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a popular data science platform. Follow the steps below to install Anaconda, set up your virtual environment, and begin using Jupyter Notebooks!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Installation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose appropriate operating system and download the **Python 3** installer:\n",
    "![image](./images/conda_install.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Follow the installation instructions\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you are a <b>Windows</b> user, choose to also install <b>Anaconda Prompt</b> when prompted by the installer -- this will be your terminal from which you will activate virtual environments and access your Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To verify that Anaconda has been installed, open up your terminal and \\*run the following command: `conda --version`  \n",
    "(\\*type the exact command as written and hit enter)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your installation was successful, your message should say `conda` with the version number of your Anaconda. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### II. Set-Up: Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We create virtual environments to use different version of applications and libraries. Virtual environments allow you to use isolated python environments to install different versions of libraries. Here, we will make a new virtual environment called `wids-datathon` and show you how to activate/deactive it.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Open your Terminal** (for Windows, open Anaconda Prompt)  \n",
    "2. In your terminal, **run the command**:\n",
    "    `conda create -n wids-datathon python=3 anaconda`  \n",
    "    You've now created your virtual environment!  \n",
    "3. To **activate** this virtual environment, run:  \n",
    "    &ensp; \\- on Mac or Linux: `source activate wids-datathon`  \n",
    "    &ensp; \\- on Windows: `activate wids-datathon`  \n",
    "4. To **deactivate** virtual environment:  \n",
    "    &ensp; \\- Mac or Linux: `source deactivate`  \n",
    "    &ensp; \\- Windows: `deactivate`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Remember to always activate your virtual environment first before you install packages or run a notebook. This prevents the potential of crashing your root Python/Anaconda installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Navigating Your Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can run the command to start your Jupyer Notebook server. However, it will open in your home directory and you will have to click through your folders to find the file you want to open. To prevent this, you can **navigate to the desired directory first** in the terminal, and open the server to that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"directory\" is just another term for \"folder\" -- your Desktop folder is a directory, as are your Downloads, Documents, and OneDrive folders. All you are doing here is laying out the path you will take from your home directory to whichever folder you want to work from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic commands in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cd <path to directory>`: you can navigate through your directories from your root with the `cd` command by specifying a path to your desired directory.\n",
    "    - e.g. If your home directory contains your `Desktop` folder, `cd Desktop` takes you from Home to your Desktop directory.\n",
    "    - e.g. If your `Desktop` folder contains folder `WiDS` which contains the folder `Datathon`, the following command from your Home Directory takes you to the Datathon folder: `cd Desktop/WiDS/Datathon`\n",
    "- `cd ..`: this allows you to go back to the previous directory (called the parent directory)\n",
    "    - e.g. `WiDS` is the parent folder of `Datathon`, so from the `Datathon` folder, `cd ..` will take you to the `WiDS` folder.\n",
    "- `ls` or `dir`: lists all folders/files in the current directory. This is a good way to check, for example, if your parent folder contains your Desktop folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how to navigate directories from your terminal! Find your desired directory **before** you run the JupyterHub Server to prevent clicking through layers of folders. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### IV. Create Your First Notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebooks which is what we will use throughout this tutorial. In order to create your first notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your terminal (for Windows users, use Anaconda Prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activate your virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigate to your desired directory\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Run the following command on your terminal: `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your default browser window will open, and you should be in your specified directory. From here, you can create a new notebook, open and edit saved notebooks, and much, much more!\n",
    "\n",
    "To close the notebook server (and shut down all running notebooks), run the command: `jupyter notebook stop` OR simply hit `Ctrl + c` in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### V. Downloading the WiDS Datathon Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are ready to download and interact with our tutorial notebooks. To access then, simpyly:\n",
    "1. Go to: https://github.com/keikokamei/WiDS_Datathon_Tutorials\n",
    "2. Download a ZIP file of the repository, as pictured below \n",
    "3. Unzip the folder into your desired directory\n",
    "4. Navigate to this directory in your terminal (step 3. from above) and start running your Jupyter Notebook server (step 4.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![download_repo](./images/download_repo.PNG)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your default browser opens up to this directory, you will be able to open up and interact with the tutorials. Happy datathon prepping! :)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
