### Welcome to your repository of introductory data science tutorials!

This tutorial is aimed to introduce basic data science skills and concepts to datathon participants with little to no background in statistics or computer science. In these [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) tutorials, you will learn to use the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language to explore fundamental statistical concepts and become familiar with various data values, structures and manipulation techniques.  

If you do not already have Anaconda installed on your computer, **it is highly recommended that you first follow the "Anaconda Installation Guide" to download and install Anaconda to access your Jupyter Notebooks.** This will allow you to download and work interactively through your own copy of the tutorial notebooks, and it will set you up with an environment to tackle your datathon challenge should this be the data science platform you choose to use.
