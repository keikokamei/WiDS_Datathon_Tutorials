    "In the previous notebook, we looked at ways to store and work with a collection of data values within a sequence, like a list or an array. We also explored insights we can gain from computing summary statistics on those collections of data. Now we need a way to store and work with **multiple** separate collections of information about the same population - e.g. in addition to the test scores of the class, perhaps we also know the students' IDs, and results from one other exam they have taken in the past. In this notebook, we will work with data structures that allow us to store multiple pieces of information, or **features**, about a population; and we will explore a powerful library that allows us to read in, explore and manipulate datasets.\n",

One way to analyze whether we may be onto something is to compute the feature's summary statistic separately for the two groups, and see if we observe a notable difference. We can do this with the `.groupby()` method for Pandas DataFrames, which organizes the data into groups based on the values of the group-by variable, and computes an aggregation on the members of each group such that we are left with an aggregate value for each group.

While there is a lot more to learn beyond what's covered in this tutorial when it comes to the art and science of working with data, you have begun to build a solid foundation from which you can dive into the world of data science. As long as you remain curious and leverage the many resources available to you (documentation sites, Kaggle community, Stack Overflow, WiDS workshops, etc.), you are bound to rapidly develop your data science repertoire. Good luck, and have fun!\n",
