    "In the last tutorial, we learned how to define our own functions. But writing functions is time-consuming, and much of the statistical and data wrangling operations we need have already been written for us by someone else. Rather than reinventing the wheel, it is much more efficient to leverage code that already exist. Further, rather than copying raw code into our notebooks, we can import what are called **Python modules, packages, and libraries** straight into Jupyter Notebooks. Python modules are Python files that contain the code for functions; once imported, they allow us to call upon the function names defined in the file. Python packages and libraries are just larger collections of Python modules, and can be leveraged in much the same way.\n",

    "\n",
    "Whereas the median is calculated based on the rank, or position, of the values and therefore is quite indirectly dependent on each individual value, the mean is directly dependent on the values themselves. In our example, the outlier of 0 is having the effect of pulling the sum of the scores down quite significantly before the total is divided by the number of scores. The median, on the other hand, is not nearly as affected by the value of the minimum - even if we were to <span style='color:#F4BB44'>change the minimum value</span>, as long as the value is less than or equal to the current median value, <span style='color:navy'>the median will not change</span>:\n",

This is because **in <u>all numerical data sets</u> (!), a majority of the data values fall within a few standard deviations of the average\"**. In other words, we can rely on the fact that most of the data will be found within 3-4 SDs above and below the mean. When you say, \"I scored 3.6 points higher than the class average\", we don't quite know how good that result is. But when you say, \"I scored a standard deviation above the average\", we know that that is notably higher than the class average, because it is in the context of the distribution of scores. The <b>number of standard deviations</b> a specific data point is from the mean can tell us where we would expect that point to land on the histogram.\n",

It can take many different arguments depending on the desired specifications, but we can just accept the default for the optional parameters. The only required parameter is `filepath_or_buffer`, which asks for the **file path**, or location, of the data file on your computer so that it can find it and turn it into a Pandas dataframe.
