    "In the last tutorial, we learned how to define our own functions. But writing functions is time-consuming, and much of the statistical and data wrangling operations we need have already been written for us by someone else. Rather than reinventing the wheel, it is much more efficient to leverage code that already exist. Further, rather than copying raw code into our notebooks, we can import what are called **Python modules, packages, and libraries** straight into Jupyter Notebooks. Python modules are Python files that contain the code for functions; once imported, they allow us to call upon the function names defined in the file. Python packages and libraries are just larger collections of Python modules, and can be leveraged in much the same way.\n",

    "The blue triangle marks the median value, and the orange triange marks the mean. Remember that the <span style='color:navy'><b>median</b></span> marks the \"halfway point\" of the data - half of the data values lie below the median, and the other half above the median. If we measured the area of the bars to the left of the median, and the area of the bars to its right, we would find they are roughly 0.5 (50%) each. \n",

    "What about the <span style='color:#CC5500'><b>mean</b></span>? On the histogram, we can see that a majority of the data points are above the mean value.

    "It may help to imagine the bars of the histogram as weights stacked on top of a balancing board. If we were to balance the histogram at a singular point of the board, where would we place the fulcrum? If placed near 80, the figure will tip to the left; if placed near 0, the figure will tip to the right. Somewhere in between is the point where the figure will balance - that point is 69.90666, the mean.\n"

When you say, \"I scored 3.6 points higher than the class average\", we don't quite know how good that result is. But when you say, \"I scored a standard deviation above the average\", we know that that is notably higher than the class average, because it is in the context of the distribution of scores.
